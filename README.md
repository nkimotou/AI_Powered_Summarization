# AI_Powered_Summarization
Rad AI ML infrastructure engineer challenge

## Instructions
Create a FastAPI service that loads a pre-trained Hugging Face NLP model to do text summarization on user-provided text inputs. The service should expose an API to receive a text input and return a summary in a JSON Response.

### Requirements
-Set up a Python environment with the dependencies (FastAPI, Hugging Face Transformers, anything else you see fit).

-Choose a pre-trained NLP model from the Hugging Face Model Hub that is suitable for text summarization.

-An endpoint that takes a JSON input, for the user provided text and returns a response with the result. An example request-response can be like:

``{
"text": "This is a long text input that needs to be summarized. The FastAPI service should be able to handle lengthy inputs and generate a coherent summary based on the user-defined summary length...",
"summary_length": 50
}
``

``
{
"summary": "A brief summary of the lengthy input text, generated by the pre-trained Hugging Face model."
}
``

-Containerize the FastAPI service using Docker, and provide a Dockerfile and instructions on how to build and run the Docker container.

-Include a README that explains how to run a service.
## Optional (extension of the original task)
After generating the summarized text, compress it using the following algorithm and return the compressed summary string.

**Compress Summary Endpoint:** 

Implement a POST endpoint /compress_summary that accepts the same input as /summarize and returns the compressed summary string.

**The compression algorithm is as follows:**

For each group of consecutive repeating characters in the summarized text:

-If the group's length is 1, append the character to the compressed string.

-Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

-The compressed string should be returned in the JSON response from the /compress_summary endpoint.â€™

**Original Summary:** 
`This committee meets annually to assess the effectiveness of policies on environmental protection.`

**Compressed Summary:**
`Thus com2it2e2 me2ts an2ual2y to as2es2 the ef2ectivenes2 of policies on environmental protection.`

## Developer Notes
I've created this with the intention of making it very easy for someone not familiar with the used tools 
to be able to run this application with no major issues. 

I've left much more frequent comments in the included files than I usually would, in order to explain everything line by line. 
Ideally, an intern should be able to take this app and fully understand everything from end to end. 

Please reach out to me at [nkimotou@gmail.com](nkimotou@gmail.com) for any questions or clarification.

## Process
**Python environment:**

I'm using JetBrains PyCharm IDE running Python 3.12 on a 2023 Mac Studio M2 Max 32gb ram. 
All of my commands are executed by accessing the terminal inside the IDE. 

I'm starting on a working branch in the production repo. I will PR and merge into the master once 
completed. To export the application, I will download the zipped file.

**Imports and dependencies:**

-FastAPI package to import the FastAPI class to build the service, HTTPException to flag web server status codes.

-Hugging Face transformers package to import the pipeline function for running tasks against models.

-Pydantic package to import the BaseModel class for converting Python objects into usable JSON.

-Uvicorn to be used alongside FastAPI to run the web application in the localhost.

## How to run this application locally 
**Step 1:** Download this repo as a zip file
><img height="250" src="zip.png" width="350"/>

**Step 2:** Dependencies
> Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your machine or inside your Python IDE.
> The app.py and requirements.txt files show the dependencies required.
>
> From app.py:
> 
> `from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException`
> 
>`from transformers import pipeline`
> 
>`from pydantic import BaseModel`
> 
> From requirements.txt:
> 
> `fastapi`
> 
>`transformers`
> 
>`uvicorn`

**Step 3:** Set up Docker and build the image
> If you don't already have it installed, you can do so on command line or from
> Docker's website. Navigate to the appropriate package directory inside the unzipped repo file
> using the terminal. 
> 
> <img height="100" src="pcharmnav.png" width="600"/>

> Once in the correct path, execute the following command:

`docker build -t <docker_image_name>`
>The terminal output should look similar to this:

> <img height="400" src="pycharmterm.png" width="1000"/>

**Step 4:** Run the Docker container
> After setting up docker and building the image, run the container using the following command:

`docker run -d -p <your_port:your_port> <docker_image_name>`

> Here is what mine looks like:

> <img height="25" src="dockerrun.png" width="650"/>

> Check that your container is running properly by using the following command:

`docker ps`
> This will return information about your running containers and their status.

**Step 5:** Check your localhost!
>You should now be able to access this service through your localhost.

`http://localhost:8000/ai_summarizer/`

## How to create your own version from scratch!
**Step 1:** Package and directory
> Create a package that will contain everything needed to run the application. In this case,
> mine is called "Summarizer". When you create a package, it should auto create your init.py file for you.

**Step 2:** Interpreter settings
>Make sure your IDE has interpreter settings set to allow a virtual environment, or venv, to be used. 
> This is what it should look like:

> <img height="200" src="layout.png" width="400"/>

**Step 3:** Create the files required inside your package
> For this project, I want to create three:
> 1. My app file that has my summarizer code in it
> 2. My Dockerfile that has instructions to pass to Docker, in order to build the Docker Image.
> 3. My requirements.txt that has my required dependencies in order for the application to run containerized in Docker.
> 
> The structure can be seen above.

**Step 4:** Set up Docker and build the image
> If you don't already have it installed, you can do so on command line or from
> Docker's website. Once you've got your app package and files set up, navigate to your package directory
> using the terminal. 
> 
> <img height="100" src="pcharmnav.png" width="600"/>

> Once in the correct path, execute the following command:

`docker build -t <docker_image_name>`
>The terminal output should look similar to this:

> <img height="400" src="pycharmterm.png" width="1000"/>

**Step 5:** Run the Docker container
> After setting up docker and building the image, run the container using the following command:

`docker run -d -p <your_port:your_port> <docker_image_name>`

> Here is what mine looks like:

> <img height="25" src="dockerrun.png" width="650"/>

> Check that your container is running properly by using the following command:

`docker ps`
> This will return information about your running containers and their status.

**Step 6:** Check your localhost!
>You should now be able to access your service through your localhost. 

`http://localhost:<your_port>/<docker_image_name>/`
> In my case, mine looks like this:

`http://localhost:8000/ai_summarizer/`
